      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
          hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and
          discard grease. Mix in sesame oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine brown sugar, soy sauce, water, asian pear, garlic, ginger, red
          pepper flakes, and black pepper in a food processor. Blend until
          combined but slightly chunky. Pour mixture into the skillet with the
          beef and cook over medium heat until most of the liquid evaporates, 7
          to 9 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place 1/4 the cooked brown rice in the bottom of an individual serving
          bowl. Top with a portion of beef mixture, lettuce, cucumber, red bell
          pepper, and sesame seeds. Repeat with the remaining.
